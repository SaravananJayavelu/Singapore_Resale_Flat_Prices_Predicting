# Singapore_Resale_Flat_Prices_Predicting
# Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.
# Challenges:
  The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and it can be challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. There are many factors that can affect resale prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A predictive model can help to overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors
# Scope:
The project will involve the following tasks:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
2.	Feature Engineering:
3.	Model Selection and Training:
4.	Model Evaluation:
5.	Streamlit Web Application
6.	Deployment on Render
7.	Testing and Validation

# Results: 
  The project will benefit both potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market. Buyers can use the application to estimate resale prices and make informed decisions, while sellers can get an idea of their flat's potential market value. Additionally, the project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.
